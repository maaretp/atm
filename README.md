# Assignment

**An ATM allows a daily withdraw limit of $300**

You canâ€™t ask the stakeholder any questions about the requirement, what tests would you run to understand the requirement better and test this functionality?

You can run the ATM by 'python3 atm_main.py'

One sample test is available to run with 'pytest test_my_atm.py'
